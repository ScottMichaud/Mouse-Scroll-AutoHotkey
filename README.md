AutoHotkey Mouse Scroll
=======================

A very simple script which persuades Mouse Button 4 and Mouse Button 5 into sending scrolling events. 

Should be easier and more smooth to scroll large documents than universal scroll or the scroll wheel.

By default, the script waits 200ms after first scroll to send the second. Many values were tried but this seemed the quickest delay to comfortably press and send only one scroll event. Holding down further sends another scroll event every 25ms until release.

Build with [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) and place the output .exe in your Startup folder.
